With that in mind, Intel has developed the Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL), a highly optimized library whose goal is to provide a full solution for data analytics targeting today's highly parallel systems such as Intel Xeon Phi.   \n",

Our goal is, at each step, to decrease the error in our equation for which the dependent variable is the result, e.g., assuming that we are fitting a linear model to our data. The error value of our model can be thought as the sum of all the errors for each data point. We can imagine this as the distance between our model equation line and the data points. That is the intuitive insight behind the fitting operation.  \n",

    "In some cases, the behavior of the data cannot be approximated using a linear function. A very popular technique for improving the model quality for those cases where linear functions are not enough is Polynomial Feature Expansion. In this technique we include derived features from the original dataset, changing the equation of the regression into a higher order polynomial. Thus, a polynomial expansion of second degree would introduce quadratic versions of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple linear regression equation shown - $y^{(i)} = \\theta_0+\\theta_1x_1^{(i)}+\\theta_2x_2^{(i)}+...++\\theta_mx_m^{(i)}$ becomes, in the quadratic expansion: \n",

    "Unfortunately we were not able to do the expansion using the Normal Equation method. The pyDAAL reported that the it was not able to solve the linear system in order to calculate the $\\Theta$ vector. Instead, we used the expansion with another type of Regression strategy, named Ridge regression. This type of regression is less susceptible to multicolinearity - a phenomenon that occurs when two or more features are extremely correlated. One can see that the Polynomial feature expansion, although improved a little the error, has no real effect on this type of regression.\n",
